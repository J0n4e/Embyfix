# Releasing Cove

Releases are built, signed and attested by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build-app.yml`). The in-app
updater installs a release only if `Cove.zip.sig` verifies against the public key built into the app, so a
zip uploaded by hand is refused.

The signing secrets live in the GitHub **Environment `release`**, which only `v*` tags may use, and a **tag
ruleset** lets only the repository owner create `v*` tags. So a pull request, a branch, or someone with write
access (or a stolen write-access account) cannot get a build signed. Pull requests and *Run workflow* build
without any secrets (ad-hoc signature).

## One-time setup (repository owner)

1. **Environment** (Settings → Environments → New environment → `release`):
   - *Deployment branches and tags* → **Selected branches and tags** → *Add deployment branch or tag rule* →
     Ref type **Tag**, pattern `v*`. Do not add any branch rule.
   - Optional, recommended: *Required reviewers* → yourself. Each release then waits for one click
     (*Review deployments → Approve*) before the secrets are used.
2. **Update-signing key** (Ed25519), stored in the environment:
   ```sh
   swift scripts/make-update-key.swift
   gh secret set COVE_UPDATE_KEY --env release -R J0n4e/cove < update-key.private
   ```
   Put the printed **public key** into `Sources/Updater.swift` (`static let publicKey = "..."`) in a PR.
   Save `update-key.private` in your password manager, then delete it. **Never commit it.**
3. **Code-signing certificate** (self-signed, gives every release the same identity). Note: without an Apple
   Developer ID (Team ID) macOS still ties Keychain items to each exact build, so Cove keeps sign-ins in its
   preferences file for now; Keychain storage returns once releases are signed with a Developer ID:
   ```sh
   scripts/make-signing-cert.sh --github     # creates cove-signing.p12, sets CODESIGN_P12 / CODESIGN_P12_PASSWORD in "release"
   ```
   Save `cove-signing.p12` and its password in your password manager, then delete the file.
4. **No signing secrets at repository level.** Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → *Repository
   secrets* must not contain `COVE_UPDATE_KEY`, `CODESIGN_P12` or `CODESIGN_P12_PASSWORD` (any workflow on any
   branch can read repository secrets).
5. **Protect the release tags** (Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset → *New tag ruleset*):
   name `release-tags`, enforcement **Active**, *Bypass list* → **Repository admin**, target → *Include by
   pattern* `v*`, rules **Restrict creations**, **Restrict updates**, **Restrict deletions**, **Block force
   pushes**.
6. **Protect the branches** (Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New branch ruleset), for `main` and `Development`:
   *Restrict deletions*, *Block force pushes*, *Require a pull request before merging* (1 approval for `main`).
   Also turn on two-factor authentication for every account with write access, and
   *Settings → Code security → Private vulnerability reporting*.

Only the repository owner can add environments, secrets and rulesets.

## Each release

1. Merge `Development` into `main` (PR), as before.
2. The **owner** tags the merge commit and pushes the tag (other accounts are blocked by the tag ruleset):
   ```sh
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag v1.16.0 && git push origin v1.16.0
   ```
3. The `release` job builds the app, signs it with the certificate, signs `Cove.zip` with the update key, adds a
   build attestation and creates a **draft** release with `Cove.zip` and `Cove.zip.sig`. With required reviewers
   on, approve the deployment first (Actions → the run → *Review deployments*).
4. Open the draft on GitHub, write the release notes and **Publish**. Pre-releases are ignored by the updater.

Anyone can check that a download came from this repository's workflow:
`gh attestation verify Cove.zip -R J0n4e/cove`.

*Run workflow* on the Actions tab builds an unsigned (ad-hoc) test artifact without creating a release.

## If a key leaks

- **Update key:** make a new pair, ship a release that contains the new public key (signed with the OLD key so
  current users can still update), then switch the secret to the new private key.
- **Certificate:** make a new one and update the two secrets in the `release` environment.
