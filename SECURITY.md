# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security problems **privately**, through GitHub:
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/J0n4e/cove/security/advisories/new) (Security tab → *Report a vulnerability*).
Please don't open a public issue. We'll reply as soon as we can and credit you in the release notes if you like.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release gets security fixes. Cove updates itself (Cove → Check for Updates…).

## What Cove does to protect you

- Updates install only if they are signed with Cove's release key (Ed25519) and match GitHub's checksum.
- Releases are built by GitHub Actions and carry a build attestation:
  `gh attestation verify Cove.zip -R J0n4e/cove`.
- Cove talks only to the media servers you add and to `api.github.com` (update check, can be turned off).
- Your password is never stored; Cove keeps the server's sign-in token instead, and Sign Out ends that session on the server.
